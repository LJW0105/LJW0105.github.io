Hi there! I'm a PhD student in the [Theory of Computation Group](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Daniel Hsu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/) and [Jeannette Wing](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wing/).
