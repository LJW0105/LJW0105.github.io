Hi there! I'm a PhD student in the [Theory of Computation Group](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Daniel Hsu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/) and [Jeannette Wing](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wing/). My broad research areas are: algorithmic statistics, machine learning theory, and online learning.

A bit more specifically, my research focuses on statistical learning in settings where the training and test distributions differ: this might arise, for instance, from distribution shift or demand for a more fine-grained notion of accuracy on subgroups. I also like thinking about online learning, sequential decision-making, and all the [cool theory](https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/predbook/) that comes out of it.

I typically go by Sam, and my pronouns are *he/him/his.*
