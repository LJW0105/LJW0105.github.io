Hi, I'm Jingwen, a PhD student in the [Theory of Computation Group](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Daniel Hsu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/) and [Alex Andoni](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~andoni/). I obtained my undergraduate degree at UC San Diego, where I majored in mathematics and computer science. During my time at UCSD, I'm extremely honored to work with glorious [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/) and [Russell Impagliazzo](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/), who sparked my interest in ML theory and TCS research. I was also very lucky to work with [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/), who introduced me to CS research. 

My research interest lies broadly in machine learning theory, algorithmic statistics, and deep learning theory. Specifically, I'm interested in designing computationally and sample-efficient algorithms that can adapt to the low-dimensional structure of the data, for tasks like learning [multi-index models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05426) or more general non-linear feature learning settings. I'm also curious about the theory of transformers, particularly understanding what kinds of algorithms they can implement and efficiently learn, exploring how to train them or design training data to help them learn correct algorithms, and developing more efficient alternatives that retain their representational power.

## Teaching and Service

I have served as a reviewer for: COLT 2025, ICML MOSS workshop 2025, Neurips M3L workshop 2024. 

I was also a volunteer for [Pre-Submission Application Review (PAR) Program](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/cscu-phd-par-program/) which provides reviews of statements and CV from students applying to the CS PhD Program at Columbia. 

I was a teaching assistant for the following classes:
- Theoretical Foundations of LLMs, by Daniel Hsu, spring 2025, Columbia University
- Machine Learning Theory, by Daniel Hsu, spring 2024, Columbia University
- Machine Learning, by Sanjoy Dasgupta, winter 2023, UCSD
- Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems, by Russell Impagliazzo, fall 2022, UCSD
- Software Project for Computer Architecture, by Hung-Wei Tseng, summer 2022, UCSD
- Introduction to Programming, by Gerald Soosairaj, spring 2022, UCSD

I was a grader for the following classes:
- Abstract Algebra, fall 2021, UCSD
- Differential Equations, spring 2021, UCSD
- Mathematical Reasoning, winter 2021, UCSD
